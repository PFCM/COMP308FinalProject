To compile:
   %> make

to run
   %> ./smokeparticles

It will take off immediately giving you a sphere full of 800000
tracer particles and 5 vortons which will float around and
disappear. If you shift+click, it will happen again, only
a bit differently.

Some information should be showing on the top left such
as framerate and how many particles are still alive.


There are a number of controls:

      MOUSE
	shift+click -- seed another set of particles
	click+drag  -- move the camera around

      KEYBOARD
	enter   -- toggle overlay
	v       -- show vortons as small spheres
	      	   red line is velocity
		   green line is vorticity
	[ or ] 	-- increase/decrease timestep, note
	     	   that this can have some stability
		   or aesthetic ramifications if
		   you aren't also fiddling with the
		   deltas for the finite differences
	p	-- toggle tracer particle display mode, 
		   either fairly large dots, or thin
		   lines. The lines' length is their
		   velocity, this was originally for
		   debugging but actually looks quite 
		   nice.
	9 or 0 	-- change the number of tracers per 
	     	   update thread. The threading is a
		   bit dumb and this doesn't change 
		   much.
	space  -- play/pause
	8 or 7 -- increase/decrease the displacement 
	       	  used in calculating the vorticity.
		  smaller values will be less stable/
		  more twitchy and weird, may explode.
		  Larger values might be a bit boring.
	5 or 6 -- increase/decrease the displacement
	       	  used in calculating the velocity.
		  Smaller values will be weirder and
		  jumpier, larger values might be too
		  smooth.
	o      -- toggle between sphere or torus. This
	       	  influences the shape in which the 
		  tracer particles are initially 
		  seeded.
	i      -- toggle whether the tracer particles
	       	  are seeded solely on the surface of
		  the shape or not. When they are just
		  on the surface it can be a bit easier
		  to see what is going on.
	UP     -- Increase the number of vortons seeded
	       	  next time you shift+click (by 1).
	DOWN   -- Decrease the number of vortons seeded
	       	  next time uou shift+click (by 1).
	LEFT   -- Decrease the number of tracers seeded
	       	  next time you shift+click (by 1000).
	RIGHT  -- Increase the number of tracers seeded
	       	  next time you shift+click (by 1000).
